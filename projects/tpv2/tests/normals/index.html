    <h1>Perturbing object paths using normal maps</h1>
    <p>For my game project I want the environments to have a subjective, painterly look, but I don't want them to feel like flat backdrops. So I thought of painting the environments in 2D, and using normal maps to create 3D terrain. I've never heard of normal maps being used for this purpose, but I think the effect could be really cool.
    <p>(All the assets were drawn in Photoshop. Nothing is 3d-modeled.)</p>
    <h2><a href="sphere.html">Experiment 1: A sphere</a></h2>
    <p>A ball follows the contours of a sphere. This was my first attempt, in which I just calculated a faux penetration vector and subtracted it from the movement vector. I'm pretty sure the math is off, but it's visually convincing.</p>
    <h2><a href="ramp.html">Experiment 2: A bunch of ramps</a></h2>
    <p>Here I had another idea: rotate the character's plane of movement to the plane defined by the surface normal. This seems to allow more precision.</p>
