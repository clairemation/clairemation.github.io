**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**

I thought I understood padding, borders, and margins before, but I got a lot of unexpected results and learned a lot about how they can affect the element's positioning. It was also fun playing with the border-radius attribute.

**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**

I learned a lot about the flow of the page, and how floating and clearing elements works.

**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**
Setting up the basic structure was more straightforward than I'd feared, but getting things to line up perfectly was an exercise in frustration.

**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**
First, using Chrome's DevTools is a great help in tweaking layouts and even in figuring out where little empty spaces are coming from. I also learned a lot about positioning items on the page, inside and outside the regular flow.
