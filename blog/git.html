            <p>My desk sagged underneath a ream of printouts, bristling with flags and checkered with ballpoint ink. Now to apply my edits to the digital file. Blackened and callused fingers took the mouse. I dragged the manuscript from the server to my desktop. I lined up my pen at the first correction on my page, opened the file, and found a completely different opening sentence. Another editor had gotten there first and edited the manuscript from under me, leaving me lost with a pile of useless corrections.

            <p>
              What I and my fellow editorial staff failed to practice was <i>version control.</i> Most people have probably had version-control screwups—have you ever made hours of progress on a document only to realize you deleted something really important part a long time ago? But when you're working in a <i>team,</i> the possibility of a disaster, and the severity of the consequences, increases exponentially by the number of team members.
            </p>

            <span class ="breakout">Enter git.</span>

            <p>
              Git is a version control management system for your computer. It lets you create separate version branches for different features you want to add, and save snapshots of your project as you go. If you run into a problem, you can always fall back to the last snapshot, or the parent branch. And it's easy to track down what happened. Git logs every single change that was made since the last snapshot, along with who made it, when they made it, and why. In a group project, you can ultimately submit your changes to the group, and a supervisor can see the differences line-by-line and make sure no conflicts will arise before merging them into the master project.
           </p>

            <span class ="breakout">A hub for gits</span>

            <p>
              You'll probably want a central place to store your master branch. Someplace everyone on the team can access, even when the rest of the team isn't online. Enter GitHub, a popular online site for hosting git projects (called repositories). Think of GitHub as cloud storage for git. GitHub lets you choose privacy settings and license terms for your repositories, contribute to other GitHub projects, and invite contributions to your own. GitHub is more than storage—it's a great place to put your code if you want to show it to other people, or open it up to collaboration.
