<p>I talked last week about objects, the building blocks of Ruby. Just as everything in Ruby is an object, it shouldn’t surprise that every object is itself one of a class of objects. Let’s create some objects and classes modeled on things in real life. Since this is an online blog about web development, I’ll use the idiom of the Internet and use kittens with hats.</p>

<section class = "copy">
<p>Say you want to create Ruby objects to represent this quartet of dandy felines. What are some traits we might want to specify in the instance variables?</p>
<!-- </section> -->
<code class="pseudo">
name
color
hat
</code>

<!-- <section class = "copy"> -->
<p>What are some actions they can perform using methods?</p>
<!-- </section> -->

<code class="pseudo">
meow
scratch
wash
</code>

<!-- <section class = "copy"> -->
<p>But wait a second... Let’s go back to the traits. Name, color, hat. A hat is also an object, isn’t it? And it has essential traits of its own. That’s perfectly fine. Objects can contain other objects. We can store a kitten’s name and color as strings or symbols, and store their hat as a custom object with its own properties, like style and material. It could even have its own methods, which will probably be limited to ones that retrieve and modify its properties, since there’s not much that a hat can actively do.</p>

<p>So let’s draw up our kittens. For the purposes of this demonstration we’ll use a sort of pseudocode. See the bottom of the page for the proper Ruby code.</p>
<!-- </section> -->

<code class="pseudo">
inky (
  name = Inky
  color = ginger
  hat = sombrero

  method meow: [instructions]
  method scratch: [instructions]
  method wash: [instructions]
)

winky(
  name = Winky
  color = calico
  hat = beanie

  method meow: [instructions]
  method scratch: [instructions]
  method wash: [instructions]
)

blinky (
  name = Blinky
  color = tabby
  hat =  witch’s hat

  method meow: [instructions]
  method scratch: [instructions]
  method wash: [instructions]
)

clyde (
  name = Clyde
  color = gi
</code>

<!-- <section class = "copy"> -->
<p>All right, this is already getting old. Most of this is just repetition! The cats all have the same types of variables, and the same methods. If there’s anything programmers hate to do, it’s repeat themselves. They hate repeating themselves.</p>

<p>Furthermore, what would happen if we tried to compare two different cats, like we do with strings or integers?</p>
<!-- </section> -->

<code class="block">
1 + 3 + 6  => 10
number === 10 => true

winky + blinky  => ??
inky === clyde => ??
</code>

<!-- <section class = "copy"> -->
<p>Ruby has no idea what to do here. It doesn’t have any basis for determining what it means for two kittens to equal each other, let alone what it means to add kittens. (Actually, neither do I... Let's just pretend kittens can combine to form a Megakitten.)</p>

<p>Anyway, we can solve all these problems! Let’s create a CLASS!</p>

<p>A class is what it sounds like--a type of object. We can create a prototypical kitten, and then all objects of that class will follow that model.</p>
<!-- </section> -->

<code class="pseudo">
class Kitten (
  String name
  Symbol color
  Hat hat

  method meow: [instructions]
  method scratch: [instructions]
  method wash: [instructions]
)
</code>

<!-- <section class = "copy"> -->
<p>Now all we have to do to create our litter is this:</p>
<!-- </section> -->

<code class="pseudo">
inky, winky, blinky, clyde = new Kitten
</code>

<!-- <section class = "copy"> -->
<p>And they will all contain the variables and methods set out in the Kitten class. You can call the meow method on Inky:</p>
<!-- </section> -->

<code class="pseudo">
inky.meow =>  “Meowww!”
</code>

<!-- <section class = "copy"> -->
<p>and he’ll respond.</p>

<p>Of course, each individual kitten’s variables can have different values. C’est ça la difference. No more repeating ourselves!</p>

<p>And now we can define how members of the Kitten class relate to one another. We’ll give the class a customized set of operators (*, ===, etc.) and tell them what to do.</p>
<!-- </section> -->

<code class="pseudo">
def * [kitten 1, kitten 2] (

  create new Kitten object offspring
  offspring’s name = kitten1 Junior
  offspring’s color = kitten2’s color
  offspring’s hat = none
  return offspring
)

def === [kitten1, kitten2] (
  if kittens’ names are the same, return true
)
</code>

<!-- <section class = "copy"> -->
<p>And, of course, our hat object can be a member of a custom Hat class, or perhaps a Garment class. Classes inside classes!</p>

<p>Actually, you may have noticed, but arrays and strings are actually objects too, and have their own classes. So are integers, floats, and, well... everything! There’s no procedural difference between using our user-defined Hat object and using an object of the built-in String class.</p>

<p>So now we have a fully-functional, if not entirely useful, litter of Ruby kittens! See below for the Ruby code to make it happen.</p>

<p>Oh, wait! I never showed you what happens when you add kittens together!</p>

<h2>Ruby code</h2>

Create a new class:

<code class="block">
class Kitten

  attr_accessor :name, :color, :hat

  @name
  @color
  @hat

  def initialize(name, color, hat)
    @name = name
    @color = color
    @hat = hat
  end

  def meow
    #code goes here...
  end

  def scratch(target)
    #code goes here...
  end

  def wash
    #code goes here...
  end

  def === (kitten2)
    @name == kitten2.name
  end
end
</code>

<p>The rule in Ruby is to begin a class name with a capital letter.
Attr_accessor allows the designated instance variables to be read and written to from outside. It’s not necessary and you should be judicious about its use.
The @ is what marks an instance variable (as opposed to a local variable, which is for temporary use only).</p>
<p>Initialize is a method that every new object runs when it’s created. Here you can set initial values for your instance variables. This one takes three arguments, and sets the instance variables to them.</p>
<!-- </section> -->


<p>Create a new class object:</p>

<code class="block">
sombrero = Hat.new()
inky = Kitten.new(“Inky”, :ginger, sombrero)
</code>

<!-- <section class = "copy"> -->
<p>Work it!</p>
<!-- </section> -->

<code class="block">
if inky === blinky
  inky.meow
else
  inky.scratch(blinky)
end
</code>
